    "> _Exercise_: We try our luck with an geospatial visualization displaying results for $K = 2,\\ldots,6$. The overall idea is each value of $K$ has an associated view (you should be able to toggle between these) where each of the $K$ centroids is shown as a large colored dot (you choose the color scheme), and all GPS points belonging to that centroid are colored using a related RGB value. [My plot looks like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdataanalysis2016/master/files/week8_1.png)\n",

    "    * ** Note **: Think carefully about how you can minimize the size of the file containing the data. My file is around 700KB. Why is the size important?\n",
    "* Start by simply creating a map of the SFPD Districts using the [GeoJSON shapefiles we've lovingly found for you](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneman/socialdataanalysis2016/master/files/sfpddistricts.geojson). You get to choose the color and other parameters.\n",
    "    * You can find help in chapter 12 in the IDV book. \n",
    "    * ** Note ** : If you do not see anything, take a look at the  `scale ` value, and understand the purpose of it. \n",
    "* Start by creating the view for $K = 2$, then generalizing.\n",
    "* Think about how you want to do the toggling. We recommend building 5 simple buttons you can click.\n",
    "  - *[Optional but very cool!]*. You can make your visualization interactive by adding the following functionality. Select each view by clicking a button (standard) but then add the ability to \"preview\" results for some other value of $K$ simply by doing a hover-over of the associated button.\n",
