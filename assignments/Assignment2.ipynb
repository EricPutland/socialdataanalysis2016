    "* Think about how you want to do the toggling. We recommend building 5 simple buttons you can click.\n",
    "  - *[Optional but very cool!]*. You can make your visualization interactive by adding the following functionality. Select each view by clicking a button (standard) but then add the ability to \"preview\" results for some other value of $K$ simply by doing a hover-over of the associated button.\n",
